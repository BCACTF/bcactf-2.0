  My friend developed this encryption service,
  and he's been trying to get us all to use it.
  Sure, it's convenient and easy to use,
  and it allows you to send encrypted messages easily,
  and...

  Well, I want to get control of his service so I can monitor all the messages!
  I think he's hidden some features and files behind a secret admin passphrase.
  Can you help me access those hidden files?
hints:
  - What changes between encryptions?
  - Can you modify an encrypted message without knowing the key?
