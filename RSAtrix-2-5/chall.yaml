  We've concluded that all our problems are the result of you whippersnappers having too much information at your disposal. As a result, we've stored the encoded message in a secret vault in this beta run. Enjoy the calculator demo!
hints:
  - Make sure to read the hints from the previous RSAtrix problems, since you might not have found the intended solution...
  - Using the techniques from the previous problems, you need to manipulate the matrix into a form where the trace is useful.
