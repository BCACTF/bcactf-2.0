  Sure, you saw our first prototype, but you could obviously see it was just RSA slapped on a permutation matrix. Will you still be able to decode our messages if we conjugate our generator first?
hints:
  - Here, "conjugating a matrix" means performing a similarity transformation.
  - What happens when you take powers of a conjugated matrix?
