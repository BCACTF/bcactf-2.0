  A really fun game where you have to type the correct letter 1000 times to get the flag!
  It won't take that long, right?
  It's not like there's another way to do it...
hints:
  - Is it possible to modify the variable storing your points?
  - What does a program like GameConqueror or CheatEngine do?
