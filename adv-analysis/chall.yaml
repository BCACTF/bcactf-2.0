  The advanced course covers the same content as the non-advanced course and then some.
  Specifically, it also teaches some units on logic and geometry.

  Now, I'm personally not the biggest fan of geometry, so I'll spare you from that.
  But you'll definitely need to spend some time *logic*ing this challenge out!
hints:
  - You can't send anything after the honor pledge... or could you sneak something in?
  - What characters will `gets` read up to? What characters will `strcmp` read up to?
  - No free function addresses here! This is the advanced class, google it yourself.
