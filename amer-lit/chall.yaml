  Writing essays is so much fun!
  Watch me write all these totally meaningful words about other words...
  Actually, wait.
  You shouldn't be reading my essays.
  Shoo!
hints:
  - What's the difference between `puts` and `printf`?
  - All the program does is print what you wrote back at you... right?
  - The flag is on the stack. What else is the stack used for?
