  Congratulations, you've graduated from letters!
  Now, let's move on to numbers.

  From the BCA Course Catalog:
  > Analysis I includes linear and quadratic functions, polynomials, inequalities,
  > functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, conic sections, and geometry.

  That's a lot of cool stuff!
  I think you'll have tons of fun learning about functions in this class!
hints:
  - If you did your ABCs, you should at least see the vulnerability.
  - You can't change your grades anymore, but what else can you overwrite to cheat?
  - Functions, eh? Pass stuff in, get stuff out, simple enough. But how do computers see them?
