  Oh wow, they put a freshman in AP ABCs?
  Never thought I'd see this happen.
  Anyways, good luck, and make sure to not cheat on your AP test!
hints:
  - Decimal? Hex? What do those mean, and why should I care?
  - How <del>exactly</del> ex[*ASCII*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) are characters stored, anyways?
  - What is "endianness"? Is that like, the Ender Dragon or something?
