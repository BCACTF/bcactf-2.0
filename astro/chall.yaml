  My friend and I went stargazing and he started coming up with all these new constellations of animals.
  I personally didn't see anything, just looked like a bunch of points to me.
  Although, I might have noticed a message in those stars.

  Once you get the message, separate words with an `_` and wrap in `bcactf{...}` in order to submit the flag.
hints:
  - All the letters in the message have the same case
