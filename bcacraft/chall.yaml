  Check out my Minecraft world! The flag is conveniently located in a barrel block. If you can find it, of course...

  *(Minecraft is not required to solve this problem.)*
hints:
  - "Better get familiar with this wiki article: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Chunk_format"
  - "https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer/releases or https://pypi.org/project/anvil-parser/"
  - "There are 6 parts to the flag. There are no underscores between them. All decimals should be truncated, not rounded."
  - "All coordinates are by block (not chunk)."
