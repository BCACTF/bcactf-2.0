  My Caeser loving friend decided to send me a text file,
  but before sending it, his sister, who loves Caps Lock,
  tampered with the file. Can you help me find out what
  my friend sent me?
  Note: the answer must be wrapped in bcactf{}
hints:
  - His sister hates base 10
  - Might Y and N relate to Caps Lock
