  Hello to all the BCA students taking the Computer Security elective!
  (And hello to all the other lovely faces out there as well!)

  The compsec elective has been following *Hacking: TAOE*.
  It's a pretty good book, but let's face it, Ubuntu 7.04 is pretty old.
  So, I've changed it slightly and compiled it on a modern system!

  The flag is located in a file called `flag.txt`.
hints:
  - You'll need to mix up the lessons from the english and math courses! Englath? Mish?
  - There's no code here that opens the file. You'll need to supply that yourself.
