description: |-
  Gerald, Gerald, and Gerald were sitting in their electronics class when their teacher introduced registers and drivers (also known as controlled buffers) and all these other weird things.
  When Gerald gets home, he is eager to start prototyping a new encryption circuit with what he just learned.
  Maybe now he will be able to send messages to Gerald without Gerald listening in.
hints:
  - Look at the little bits.
