  Gerald and Gerald have just learned that Gerald has cracked their previous cypher.
  Gerald scolds Gerald, saying that he shouldn't have given away the key.
  Geral, therefore, decides to create a new cypher, hopefully one that Gerald can't crack.    
hints:
  - What does the plaintext start with?
  - Notice anything about the key?
