  BCA's top-level math track!
  We have proofs, trig, parametric, polar, linear algebra, calculus, ...
  You'll just have to demonstrate your skills before getting the flag.
hints:
  - You can't just jump to the flag function directly.
  - What happens when you jump to some function? It runs that code. What happens when *that* returns?
