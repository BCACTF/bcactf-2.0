description: |-
    The final form of FNES. No key.txt, no flag.txt, no time-based seeding,
    and no passphrases... Just raw, unadulterated elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman.

    We've intercepted some communication between Alice and Bob, and 
    nicely laid it out for you in a sequence diagram. Find the flag!
hints:
  - What happens if you try to put the curve into Sage?
