Cheating and Plagiarism Policy
==============================

To plagiarize is to steal and use (the ideas or writings of another) as one’s
own (American Heritage Dictionary, 1973:1001). Legally, plagiarism has been
defined as the act of appropriating the literary composition of another, or
parts or passages of his/her writings, or language of the same, and passing them
off as the product of one’s own mind (O’Rourke v. RKO Radio Pictures: 483). The
student should note that neither of these definitions includes intention or
motivation—it is the act itself which constitutes plagiarism. Ignorance, naiveté
or sloppiness is no excuse.

Consequences for Plagiarism or Cheating

Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and the Board expects all students
to be honest in the presentation and submission of their assignments, homework,
test answers and any other academic works as the product of their own
intellectual efforts. Any student who copies verbatim or paraphrases another’s
words or ideas or who allows one’s own words or ideas to be copied verbatim or
paraphrased shall be guilty of plagiarism. A student who shares his own words or
ideas with another or presents another’s words or ideas and attributes them as
his own is also guilty of plagiarism.

Cheating is acting dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage. Acts
of cheating may include the submission of work prepared by another but passing
it off as one’s own or copying the work or answers of another. It is also an act
or instance of sharing or allowing to be shared one’s own works, words, answers
or ideas with others. For more information see Board Policy 5701.
