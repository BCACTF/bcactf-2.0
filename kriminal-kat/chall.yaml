description: |-
  Agent Gerald is on a Super Secret Mission™ to arrest the notorious Krimelord, the Kriminal Kitten™. 
  Enraged that his adorableness makes it hard for many to take him seriously, that dastardly Kitten™
  has been planning some terrible deeds. Gerald has found the secret website that the Kriminal Kitten Krime Kompany™
  uses to chat and share files, but he needs to figure out how to sign in.

  Gerald's team believes that the site uses Kriminal Recognition Technology™ to guess which evildoer is attempting to sign in. 
  Since Gerald is not recognized, it seems to default to a random username.
  Maybe you can help Agent Gerald log in?

hints:
  - If you're not sure why this is a crypto problem, brush up on your web exploitation.
  - Can you recognize what is being done to the username and password when you press "Sign In"?
  - I hear that Kriminal Kat™ has a cousin in cybersecurity. She's pretty good with passwords.
