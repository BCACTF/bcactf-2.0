  Being a secret agent didn't exactly work out for Gerald.
  He's been training to become a translator for dinosaurs going on vacation, and he just got his traslator's licence. But 
  when he sees it, it doesn't seem to belong to him... can you help him find his licence?
hints:
  - Gerald had to know a lot of languages to become a translator. He knows there's a word for that...
