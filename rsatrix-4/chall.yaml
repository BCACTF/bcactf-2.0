description: |-
  For the final iteration of RSAtrix, we've removed all the information we could. No more matrix factors, no more given permutation, and no more primes. Can you still decrypt the flag?
hints:
  - The given generator matrix is still a conjugated permutation, like the previous problem.
  - What essential properties of the generator matrix do you need to figure out?
  - Your solution might take a while to run; my solve script took 15 minutes.
