    In today's backyard adventure, we found a cable running through the bushes! 
    We followed it as far as we could, but after half a mile it seemed to go underground. 
    Removing the wire's protective casing revealed 5 labeled wires, 3 of which were colored and all of which had a single letter.
    Thanks to generous Nick Jr. funding we bought an 8-channel oscilloscope and probed all the wires. Can you help us figure out what was sent?
hints:
  - The colors were red, green, and blue, which matched the letters r, g, b.
  - What is RGBHV?
