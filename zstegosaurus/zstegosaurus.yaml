  My friend forgot our pet zstegosaurus's name. Luckily for him, I hid the dinosaur's name somewhere in this picture...but now I can't find it.
  Can you help us?


hints:
  - The image should be black and white...right?
  - Try opening the file in a hex editor. 
  - The format for the flag is bcactf{flagName}
